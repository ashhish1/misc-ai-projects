Project 921. Image-Text Matching System

An image-text matching system is designed to associate images with corresponding textual descriptions. It helps in applications like image search, visual question answering, and multi-modal retrieval. In this project, we simulate a basic system where the goal is to match images with text using feature embeddings.

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python implementation using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model via transformers:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulate image and text data
image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")  # Replace with a valid image path
texts = ["A photo of a cat", "A photo of a dog", "A beautiful landscape"]
 
# Preprocess the image and text inputs
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Perform forward pass
outputs = model(**inputs)
 
# Calculate similarity between the image and each text
logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image # Image-text similarity scores
probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)  # Convert logits to probabilities
 
# Display the matching results
print("Image-Text Matching Results:")
for i, text in enumerate(texts):
    print(f"Text: {text} | Probability: {probs[0][i]:.4f}")
What This Does:
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is used to match images with textual descriptions.

It computes similarity between the image and the text, helping us identify the most relevant description for an image.



Project 922. Visual Question Answering (VQA)

Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems answer questions related to the content of an image. It combines both image understanding and natural language processing to generate accurate responses. In this project, we simulate a simple image-based question answering system using a pre-trained model.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation using transformers and ViLT (Vision-and-Language Transformer) for VQA:

from transformers import ViltProcessor, ViltForQuestionAnswering
import torch
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained VQA model and processor
model = ViltForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("dandelin/vilt-b32-mlm")
processor = ViltProcessor.from_pretrained("dandelin/vilt-b32-mlm")
 
# Simulate a question and an image
image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")  # Replace with a valid image path
question = "What is in the image?"
 
# Preprocess the image and question
inputs = processor(text=question, images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Perform forward pass to get model's prediction
outputs = model(**inputs)
 
# Extract the answer from the model's output
answer = outputs.logits.argmax(-1)  # Get the index of the most likely answer
answer_str = processor.decode(answer)
 
print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer_str}")
What This Does:
ViLT (Vision-and-Language Transformer) combines both vision and language inputs, enabling it to understand images and answer questions.

The model processes the question and image together to generate an answer.



Project 923. Image Captioning Implementation

Image captioning generates textual descriptions for images, enabling applications like automatic image tagging, visual storytelling, and accessible content for the visually impaired. In this project, we simulate image captioning using a pre-trained image-to-text model.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation using the transformers library and the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model:

from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained BLIP model and processor
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
 
# Simulate image for captioning
image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")  # Replace with a valid image path
 
# Preprocess the image and generate caption
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
out = model.generate(**inputs)
 
# Decode the generated caption
caption = processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
 
print(f"Generated Caption: {caption}")
What This Does:
BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) is a state-of-the-art model that generates captions for images by leveraging vision and language understanding.

It processes an image and generates a relevant textual description of its contents.

Project 924. Text-to-Image Generation

Text-to-image generation creates images from textual descriptions, enabling creative content generation and design automation. In this project, we simulate a text-to-image system using DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion, which takes a text prompt and generates a corresponding image.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation using Stable Diffusion via the diffusers library from Hugging Face:

from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
 
# Load pre-trained text-to-image generation model (Stable Diffusion)
model_id = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original"  # You can change this model ID for variations
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.to("cuda")  # Move model to GPU for faster generation
 
# Text prompt for image generation
prompt = "A futuristic city with flying cars and neon lights."
 
# Generate the image
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
 
# Show the generated image
image.show()
What This Does:
Stable Diffusion is a powerful generative model that creates high-quality images from textual prompts.

It can generate scenes, characters, objects, or even abstract concepts based on text input.

Project 925. Audio-Visual Speech Recognition

Audio-visual speech recognition combines both audio and visual cues (like lip movements) to transcribe spoken language. This improves recognition accuracy, especially in noisy environments or for users with speech impairments. In this project, we simulate a basic system using both audio and video frames.

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python implementation using DeepSpeech for audio transcription and OpenCV for lip movement detection:

ðŸ“Œ In a real-world scenario, we would need pre-trained models like DeepSpeech for audio recognition and a lip-reading model like LipNet for video input.

import cv2
import numpy as np
import deepspeech
from scipy.io import wavfile
 
# Simulate an audio file path and video file path
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a real audio file
video_file = "example_video.mp4"  # Replace with a real video file
 
# Step 1: Use DeepSpeech to transcribe the audio part of the speech
model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")  # Pretrained DeepSpeech model
fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
 
# Perform speech-to-text on the audio
audio_transcription = model.stt(audio_input)
print(f"Audio Transcription: {audio_transcription}")
 
# Step 2: Process video frames for lip reading (simplified)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
success, frame = cap.read()
 
# Example: Display a frame (simulate lip reading processing)
if success:
    cv2.imshow("Video Frame for Lip Reading", frame)
 
# Wait for a key to close the video window
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
 
# Simulated: Combine audio transcription with video frame analysis
# In a complete system, you would process lip movements in the frame to improve transcription
final_transcription = f"{audio_transcription} with lip movement analysis"
print(f"Final Transcription (Audio + Visual): {final_transcription}")
What This Does:
Audio: The DeepSpeech model transcribes speech from the audio file.

Video: OpenCV is used to capture video frames. In real applications, lip movement detection models (like LipNet) would be used to enhance the transcription accuracy by reading lips.

Project 926. Video Captioning System

A video captioning system generates textual descriptions for videos by analyzing both visual content (frames) and audio content (speech). In this project, we simulate a simple video captioning system that generates captions for a given video.

Weâ€™ll combine frame extraction (using OpenCV) and audio transcription (using a speech-to-text model) to generate basic captions for the video.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import cv2
import numpy as np
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
import deepspeech
from scipy.io import wavfile
 
# Load pre-trained BLIP model for image captioning
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
caption_model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
 
# Load DeepSpeech model for audio transcription
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Function to generate image captions using BLIP
def generate_caption(image):
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    out = caption_model.generate(**inputs)
    return processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
 
# Function to transcribe audio using DeepSpeech
def transcribe_audio(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)
 
# Video file path and audio file path
video_file = "example_video.mp4"
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
 
# Step 1: Extract frames from the video and generate captions for them
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
frame_rate = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
frame_count = 0
 
# Step 2: Transcribe audio for captions
audio_transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file)
print(f"Audio Transcription: {audio_transcription}")
 
# Step 3: Process video frames to generate captions
while True:
    success, frame = cap.read()
    if not success:
        break
 
    # Generate caption for each frame
    caption = generate_caption(frame)
    print(f"Frame {frame_count} Caption: {caption}")
 
    frame_count += 1
 
# Release the video capture object
cap.release()
 
# Example of combining audio and visual captions into final output
final_caption = f"Video Caption: {audio_transcription}. Additional frame captions generated."
print(f"Final Caption: {final_caption}")
What This Does:
Audio: We transcribe speech from the video's audio using DeepSpeech.

Video: We process each frame of the video using the BLIP model for image captioning.

Final Captioning: We combine the audio transcription with the frame captions for a complete video description.

Project 927. Multi-modal Emotion Recognition

Multi-modal emotion recognition involves analyzing both audio and visual cues (like facial expressions and voice tone) to detect emotions. This can be applied to applications like sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and customer service bots.

In this project, we simulate a multi-modal emotion recognition system by combining audio features (from speech) and visual features (from facial expressions).

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation using both audio (via DeepSpeech for transcription and basic sentiment analysis) and visual (via OpenCV for basic face emotion detection):

Step 1: Facial Emotion Detection (Visual)
Weâ€™ll use OpenCV and deepface (a simple face recognition library) to detect emotions from the facial expressions.

Step 2: Emotion Detection from Audio
Weâ€™ll extract sentiment from speech using TextBlob for simplicity (in real systems, you would use more sophisticated models like VADER or BERT-based sentiment analysis).

import cv2
import numpy as np
from deepface import DeepFace
from textblob import TextBlob
import deepspeech
from scipy.io import wavfile
 
# Load DeepSpeech model for audio transcription
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Load video and audio file
video_file = "example_video.mp4"
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
 
# Function to detect emotion from facial expressions using DeepFace
def detect_face_emotion(image):
    result = DeepFace.analyze(image, actions=['emotion'], enforce_detection=False)
    return result[0]['dominant_emotion']
 
# Function to transcribe audio using DeepSpeech
def transcribe_audio(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)
 
# Step 1: Extract frames and analyze face emotions
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
frame_rate = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
frame_count = 0
 
while True:
    success, frame = cap.read()
    if not success:
        break
 
    # Detect emotion from the frame
    emotion = detect_face_emotion(frame)
    print(f"Frame {frame_count} - Detected Emotion: {emotion}")
 
    frame_count += 1
 
cap.release()
 
# Step 2: Transcribe audio and detect sentiment
audio_transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file)
print(f"Audio Transcription: {audio_transcription}")
 
# Perform sentiment analysis on the transcribed audio
sentiment = TextBlob(audio_transcription).sentiment.polarity
if sentiment > 0:
    audio_emotion = "Positive"
elif sentiment < 0:
    audio_emotion = "Negative"
else:
    audio_emotion = "Neutral"
 
print(f"Audio Sentiment: {audio_emotion}")
 
# Combine both audio and visual emotion detection results
final_emotion = f"Visual Emotion: {emotion}, Audio Sentiment: {audio_emotion}"
print(f"Final Combined Emotion: {final_emotion}")
What This Does:
Visual Emotion Recognition: Uses DeepFace to detect dominant emotions from facial expressions (e.g., happy, sad, angry).

Audio Emotion Recognition: Uses DeepSpeech to transcribe the audio, followed by TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on the transcription (positive, negative, or neutral).

Multi-modal Analysis: Combines the emotions detected from both facial expressions and speech to produce a comprehensive emotion profile.

Project 928. Cross-modal Retrieval System

A cross-modal retrieval system allows users to retrieve information from one modality (e.g., text) based on queries from another modality (e.g., image). In this project, we simulate a simple image-to-text retrieval system, where we retrieve relevant text descriptions based on input images using pre-trained multi-modal models.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation using the CLIP model for cross-modal retrieval between images and text:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulate a text and image dataset
texts = ["A picture of a cat", "A picture of a dog", "A beautiful landscape"]
images = ["cat_image.jpg", "dog_image.jpg", "landscape_image.jpg"]  # replace with valid image paths
 
# Process image and text queries
def cross_modal_retrieval(query_image, query_texts):
    image = Image.open(query_image)
    inputs = processor(text=query_texts, images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
    # Get similarity between the image and texts
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Image-text similarity scores
    probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)  # Convert logits to probabilities
 
    # Retrieve the most relevant text for the image
    best_match_idx = torch.argmax(probs)
    return query_texts[best_match_idx], probs[0][best_match_idx].item()
 
# Simulate a query image (replace with the actual query image path)
query_image_path = "cat_image.jpg"  # Example query image
matched_text, score = cross_modal_retrieval(query_image_path, texts)
 
# Output the most relevant text description for the image
print(f"Query Image: {query_image_path}")
print(f"Most Relevant Text: {matched_text}")
print(f"Match Score: {score:.2f}")
What This Does:
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is used to align image and text embeddings in a shared space.

The system retrieves the most relevant text description for a given image by comparing their embeddings.

Project 929. Multi-modal Recommendation System

A multi-modal recommendation system leverages multiple types of data (e.g., text, image, and user interaction data) to provide personalized recommendations. In this project, we simulate a recommendation system that uses user preferences (text reviews) and product images to suggest items to a user.

Hereâ€™s a basic Python implementation using image-text embeddings from the CLIP model to generate recommendations:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulated product dataset: product images and reviews
products = [
    {"image": "product1.jpg", "text": "A stylish pair of running shoes."},
    {"image": "product2.jpg", "text": "A comfy cotton t-shirt."},
    {"image": "product3.jpg", "text": "A cozy winter jacket."},
    {"image": "product4.jpg", "text": "A sleek smartwatch with fitness tracker."}
]
 
# User's preference (text review and image of the preferred item)
user_review = "I love running shoes, especially those with great support and comfort."
user_image = "user_preferred_image.jpg"  # Replace with user preference image
 
# Function to retrieve top N recommended products based on user's preferences
def recommend_products(user_review, user_image, products, top_n=3):
    # Process user's text and image
    inputs = processor(text=[user_review] * len(products), images=[Image.open(p['image']) for p in products], return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    
    # Process user's query (text and image)
    user_inputs = processor(text=[user_review] * len(products), images=[Image.open(user_image)] * len(products), return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
    # Get similarity scores between user preferences and products
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    user_outputs = model(**user_inputs)
 
    # Compute similarity (dot product of text-image embeddings)
    text_image_similarity = torch.cosine_similarity(outputs.text_embeds, user_outputs.text_embeds)
 
    # Rank products based on similarity scores
    scores = text_image_similarity.cpu().detach().numpy()
    recommended_idx = np.argsort(scores)[-top_n:][::-1]  # Get top N recommendations
 
    # Return top N recommended products
    return [products[i] for i in recommended_idx]
 
# Get top N recommended products
recommended_products = recommend_products(user_review, user_image, products, top_n=2)
 
# Display recommended products
print("Recommended Products:")
for product in recommended_products:
    print(f"Product: {product['text']}")
What This Does:
CLIP is used to create embeddings for both the product images and user preferences (text and image).

The system calculates the cosine similarity between the user's preferences and the products, ranking products based on similarity.

Project 930. Multi-modal Medical Diagnosis

Multi-modal medical diagnosis systems combine medical imaging (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) with patient data (e.g., medical history, lab results) to improve diagnostic accuracy. In this project, we simulate a system that uses both radiology images and textual patient information to predict potential medical conditions.

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python implementation using the CLIP model for multi-modal processing:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulated medical image dataset and corresponding diagnosis text
medical_data = [
    {"image": "xray_image1.jpg", "text": "Chest X-ray showing signs of pneumonia."},
    {"image": "xray_image2.jpg", "text": "X-ray indicating a healthy lung."},
    {"image": "xray_image3.jpg", "text": "Chest X-ray showing signs of tuberculosis."},
    {"image": "xray_image4.jpg", "text": "X-ray showing a clear heart and lung fields."}
]
 
# Simulated patient information (e.g., patient symptoms, diagnosis history)
patient_info = "Patient is coughing persistently and experiencing chest pain."
 
# Function to predict the most relevant diagnosis based on the patient's info and X-ray image
def predict_medical_condition(patient_info, medical_data, top_n=2):
    # Process the medical images and associated diagnosis texts
    inputs = processor(text=[item['text'] for item in medical_data], 
                       images=[Image.open(item['image']) for item in medical_data], 
                       return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
    # Process the patient's symptoms
    patient_input = processor(text=[patient_info] * len(medical_data), 
                              images=[Image.open(item['image']) for item in medical_data], 
                              return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
    # Get model outputs for the images and texts
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    patient_outputs = model(**patient_input)
 
    # Calculate cosine similarity between the patient's input and the diagnosis results
    similarity_scores = torch.cosine_similarity(outputs.text_embeds, patient_outputs.text_embeds)
 
    # Rank products based on similarity scores
    scores = similarity_scores.cpu().detach().numpy()
    top_diagnosis_idx = np.argsort(scores)[-top_n:][::-1]  # Get top N diagnoses
 
    # Return top N predictions for diagnosis
    return [medical_data[i] for i in top_diagnosis_idx]
 
# Get the top N most relevant diagnoses based on patient input
predicted_diagnoses = predict_medical_condition(patient_info, medical_data, top_n=2)
 
# Display the predicted diagnoses
print("Top Predicted Diagnoses:")
for diagnosis in predicted_diagnoses:
    print(f"Diagnosis: {diagnosis['text']}")
What This Does:
CLIP is used to process both the medical images (X-rays) and textual descriptions (diagnosis) of the medical conditions.

It calculates the cosine similarity between the patient's symptoms and the available medical diagnoses.

Project 931. Audio-Visual Event Localization

Audio-visual event localization involves identifying and locating events in video that are triggered by both audio and visual signals. This can be used in applications like video surveillance, activity detection, and multi-modal content analysis. In this project, we simulate an audio-visual event localization system using audio recognition and object detection.

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python implementation using audio analysis (via librosa) and object detection (via OpenCV's Haar Cascades for face detection) to locate events in a video:

Step 1: Audio Event Detection
We'll use librosa for basic audio feature extraction and event detection (e.g., speech segments).

Step 2: Visual Event Localization
We'll use OpenCV with Haar Cascades to detect objects (e.g., faces) in video frames.

import cv2
import numpy as np
import librosa
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
# Step 1: Audio Event Detection using librosa
def detect_audio_event(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file)
    onset_env = librosa.onset.onset_strength(y=y, sr=sr)
    
    # Simple event detection: find peaks in the onset envelope (audio events)
    peaks = librosa.onset.onset_detect(onset_envelope=onset_env, sr=sr, units='time')
    print(f"Detected audio events at times: {peaks}")
    return peaks
 
# Step 2: Visual Event Localization using OpenCV (Haar Cascades)
def detect_faces_in_video(video_file):
    # Load Haar Cascade for face detection
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
 
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
    frame_count = 0
    face_locations = []
    
    while True:
        success, frame = cap.read()
        if not success:
            break
        
        # Convert frame to grayscale
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
 
        # Detect faces
        faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
        
        for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
            face_locations.append((frame_count, x, y, w, h))  # Store frame count and face position
 
        frame_count += 1
 
    cap.release()
    print(f"Detected faces in frames: {face_locations}")
    return face_locations
 
# Example usage:
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
video_file = "example_video.mp4"  # Replace with a valid video file
 
# Detect audio events (e.g., speech or music)
audio_events = detect_audio_event(audio_file)
 
# Detect visual events (e.g., faces) in the video
face_locations = detect_faces_in_video(video_file)
 
# Step 3: Combine audio and visual event data (e.g., synchronization)
# Example: If a face is detected in a frame when an audio event occurs, we localize it
for event_time in audio_events:
    event_frame = int(event_time * 30)  # Assume 30 fps for video
    print(f"Audio event at {event_time}s corresponds to frame {event_frame}.")
 
    # Check if there are faces in this frame
    faces_in_frame = [loc for loc in face_locations if loc[0] == event_frame]
    if faces_in_frame:
        print(f"Faces detected in frame {event_frame}: {faces_in_frame}")
What This Does:
Audio Event Detection: Uses librosa to detect audio events (e.g., speech onset times) based on the onset strength.

Visual Event Localization: Uses OpenCV Haar Cascades to detect faces in video frames.

Event Synchronization: Combines the audio and visual events by matching the frame numbers with detected audio events.

Project 932. Text-guided Image Editing

Text-guided image editing systems allow users to modify an image based on textual descriptions. This type of system combines natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to perform image manipulation (e.g., adding an object, changing colors, or removing elements) based on user inputs.

In this project, we simulate text-guided image editing using a pre-trained model for generating images from text descriptions, like Stable Diffusion or DALLÂ·E.

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python implementation using Stable Diffusion from Hugging Face's diffusers library:

from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained Stable Diffusion model and processor
model_id = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original"  # Replace with the correct model ID if needed
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.to("cuda")  # Move model to GPU for faster generation
 
# Step 1: User-provided text for image editing
prompt = "A futuristic city skyline with flying cars, neon lights, and towering skyscrapers."
 
# Step 2: Generate edited image based on text
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
 
# Display the generated image
image.show()
What This Does:
Text Input: The user provides a textual description for the desired image.

Image Generation: Using Stable Diffusion, the model generates an image based on the text prompt.

This basic system focuses on text-to-image generation, but for true text-guided editing, the model would adjust existing images rather than generating new ones.

Project 933. Text-guided Video Editing

Text-guided video editing systems allow users to modify video content based on textual descriptions, enabling applications like content creation and media manipulation. These systems can be used to change scenes, add effects, or even create entirely new content based on a text prompt.

For this project, we simulate text-guided video generation (an extension of text-to-image) using a video generation model. We'll use the same principles from text-to-image, but adapt them for video.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation using Deep Learning-based models to simulate the process:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Step 1: Load pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for text-to-video generation
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.to("cuda")  # Move model to GPU for faster generation
 
# Step 2: Text input for video generation or editing
text_prompt = "A futuristic city with flying cars and neon lights, during the day."
 
# Step 3: Generate a sequence of images (representing keyframes in a video)
frames = []
for _ in range(10):  # Generate 10 frames (adjust this for video length)
    generated_image = pipe(text_prompt).images[0]
    frames.append(generated_image)
 
# Step 4: Create a video from generated frames
import cv2
 
# Create video file from frames
frame_height, frame_width = frames[0].size
out = cv2.VideoWriter("generated_video.mp4", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'), 24, (frame_width, frame_height))
 
for frame in frames:
    # Convert PIL Image to numpy array
    frame_np = np.array(frame)
    frame_bgr = cv2.cvtColor(frame_np, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)  # Convert RGB to BGR for OpenCV
    out.write(frame_bgr)
 
out.release()
print("Video generated successfully: 'generated_video.mp4'")
What This Does:
Text Input: The user provides a textual description of the video scene.

Image Generation: Using Stable Diffusion, the model generates individual frames from the text prompt.

Video Creation: We combine these frames into a video using OpenCV.

Project 934. Cross-modal Translation

Cross-modal translation involves translating information between different modalitiesâ€”such as translating image content into text or text into audio. For instance, converting a visual scene into a descriptive paragraph or translating a text description into a corresponding image.

In this project, we simulate text-to-image translation, where we generate an image from a text description and then describe the generated image using image captioning.

Step 1: Text-to-Image Translation
Weâ€™ll use Stable Diffusion to generate an image from the provided text.

Step 2: Image-to-Text Translation
We will use BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) to caption the generated image.

Hereâ€™s the implementation:

from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for text-to-image generation
stable_diff_pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
stable_diff_pipe.to("cuda")  # Move model to GPU for faster generation
 
# Load pre-trained BLIP model for image captioning
blip_processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
blip_model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
 
# Step 1: Generate an image from the text description using Stable Diffusion
text_prompt = "A beautiful sunset over the ocean with a sailboat on the horizon."
generated_image = stable_diff_pipe(text_prompt).images[0]
 
# Step 2: Caption the generated image using BLIP
inputs = blip_processor(images=generated_image, return_tensors="pt")
out = blip_model.generate(**inputs)
caption = blip_processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
 
# Show the generated image and its caption
generated_image.show()
print(f"Generated Image Caption: {caption}")
What This Does:
Text-to-Image Translation: Generates an image from the text description using Stable Diffusion.

Image-to-Text Translation: Uses BLIP to generate a caption for the generated image.

Project 935. Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis

Multi-modal sentiment analysis combines data from multiple modalities, such as text and audio, to assess the sentiment expressed. For example, in a conversation, the tone of voice and text content can both influence the sentiment of a speaker.

In this project, we simulate multi-modal sentiment analysis by analyzing both the textual content (from user input) and the tone of voice (from audio). Weâ€™ll use TextBlob for sentiment analysis on text and librosa to extract audio features like pitch and tempo for sentiment analysis based on voice tone.

Step 1: Sentiment Analysis from Text
We'll use TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on the textual content.

Step 2: Sentiment Analysis from Audio
We'll use librosa to extract pitch and tempo features and perform sentiment analysis based on voice tone.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation:

import librosa
import numpy as np
from textblob import TextBlob
import torch
import librosa.display
 
# Step 1: Sentiment Analysis from Text using TextBlob
def text_sentiment(text):
    sentiment = TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
    if sentiment > 0:
        return "Positive"
    elif sentiment < 0:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Neutral"
 
# Example text input
text_input = "I love this product, it's amazing!"
text_sentiment_result = text_sentiment(text_input)
print(f"Text Sentiment: {text_sentiment_result}")
 
# Step 2: Sentiment Analysis from Audio using librosa
def audio_sentiment(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file)
    
    # Extract pitch (fundamental frequency) and tempo features from audio
    pitch, _ = librosa.core.piptrack(y=y, sr=sr)
    tempo, _ = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr)
 
    # Analyze the features to determine sentiment (simplified logic)
    avg_pitch = np.mean(pitch[pitch > 0])  # average pitch (higher is often more positive)
    avg_tempo = tempo  # tempo (higher tempo may indicate excitement)
 
    if avg_pitch > 200 and avg_tempo > 120:
        return "Positive"
    elif avg_pitch < 100 and avg_tempo < 100:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Neutral"
 
# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file path)
audio_input = "example_audio.wav"
audio_sentiment_result = audio_sentiment(audio_input)
print(f"Audio Sentiment: {audio_sentiment_result}")
 
# Combine both text and audio sentiment results
final_sentiment = "Overall Sentiment: " + ("Positive" if text_sentiment_result == "Positive" and audio_sentiment_result == "Positive" else "Negative" if text_sentiment_result == "Negative" or audio_sentiment_result == "Negative" else "Neutral")
print(final_sentiment)
What This Does:
Text Sentiment Analysis: Uses TextBlob to analyze the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of the text.

Audio Sentiment Analysis: Extracts pitch and tempo features using librosa, and uses simple thresholds to determine if the tone of voice is positive, negative, or neutral.

Multi-modal Sentiment: Combines the results from both text and audio to generate an overall sentiment.

Project 936. Multi-modal Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Multi-modal Named Entity Recognition (NER) extends traditional NER by recognizing entities not just from text, but from other modalities such as images or audio. For example, in a movie clip, we could extract entities like actors (from speech or subtitles) and objects (from the visual content of the video).

In this project, we simulate a basic multi-modal NER system that extracts entities from both text (using traditional NER) and images (using object detection).

Step 1: Text-based NER
We use spaCy for Named Entity Recognition on the textual content.

Step 2: Image-based NER
We use YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Haar Cascades to detect objects (acting as named entities) in images.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation that combines both approaches:

import spacy
import cv2
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Step 1: Text-based NER using spaCy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")  # Load spaCy's pre-trained NER model
 
def extract_entities_from_text(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
    return entities
 
# Example text input
text_input = "Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX, and he lives in California."
text_entities = extract_entities_from_text(text_input)
print(f"Text-based NER: {text_entities}")
 
# Step 2: Image-based NER using OpenCV (Haar Cascades for simplicity)
def detect_objects_in_image(image_path):
    # Load pre-trained Haar Cascade for face detection
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
 
    # Load the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Detect faces in the image
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
    objects_detected = []
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        objects_detected.append("Face")
        cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)  # Draw rectangle around the face
    
    # Save and display the image
    cv2.imwrite("output_image.jpg", img)
    Image.open("output_image.jpg").show()
    
    return objects_detected
 
# Example image input (replace with a valid image path)
image_path = "example_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image path
image_entities = detect_objects_in_image(image_path)
print(f"Image-based NER (Objects Detected): {image_entities}")
 
# Combining text and image NER results
final_entities = text_entities + [(entity, "Object") for entity in image_entities]
print(f"Combined Multi-modal NER: {final_entities}")
What This Does:
Text-based NER: Extracts named entities (like people, locations, and organizations) from the input text using spaCy's pre-trained NER model.

Image-based NER: Uses Haar Cascades (for simplicity) to detect objects in an image, such as faces.

Combines the results from both text and image into a multi-modal entity list.

Project 937. Multi-modal Summarization

Multi-modal summarization systems generate concise summaries that capture key information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio. In this project, we simulate multi-modal summarization by combining text summarization with image captioning, which helps summarize both the content (from text) and visual aspects (from images).

Step 1: Text Summarization
We'll use a pre-trained transformer model like BART or T5 for summarizing the text.

Step 2: Image Captioning
We'll use the BLIP model for generating captions for images, summarizing whatâ€™s visually important.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import pipeline, BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
from PIL import Image
 
# Step 1: Text Summarization using T5 or BART
text_summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
 
def summarize_text(text):
    summary = text_summarizer(text, max_length=100, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
    return summary[0]['summary_text']
 
# Example text input
text_input = """
The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous landmarks in Paris, France. It was designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel and completed in 1889. 
The tower stands at 324 meters and was initially met with skepticism, but it became an iconic symbol of France's ingenuity and elegance. 
Today, it attracts millions of tourists every year who come to see its breathtaking views of the city.
"""
text_summary = summarize_text(text_input)
print(f"Text Summary: {text_summary}")
 
# Step 2: Image Captioning using BLIP
blip_processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
blip_model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
 
def caption_image(image_path):
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    inputs = blip_processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    output = blip_model.generate(**inputs)
    caption = blip_processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return caption
 
# Example image path (replace with a valid image path)
image_path = "example_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image
image_caption = caption_image(image_path)
print(f"Image Caption: {image_caption}")
 
# Step 3: Combine Text and Image Summaries
combined_summary = f"Text Summary: {text_summary}\nImage Caption: {image_caption}"
print(f"\nCombined Multi-modal Summary: {combined_summary}")
What This Does:
Text Summarization: Uses BART (or T5) to generate a concise summary of a given text.

Image Captioning: Uses BLIP to generate a description of the visual content in an image.

Multi-modal Summary: Combines both the text summary and image caption into a single coherent summary.

Project 938. Multi-modal Dialogue System

A multi-modal dialogue system enables interaction using a combination of multiple modalitiesâ€”such as text, speech, and visual input. In this project, we simulate a basic multi-modal dialogue system that processes both spoken words (via speech-to-text) and visual cues (via object detection) to generate responses.

Step 1: Speech Recognition
We use DeepSpeech to transcribe the spoken input into text.

Step 2: Visual Input Processing
We use OpenCV for object detection (in this case, face detection using Haar Cascades) to understand visual cues during the dialogue.

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
from transformers import pipeline
 
# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Load pre-trained dialogue model for generating responses
dialogue_pipeline = pipeline("conversational", model="facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill")
 
# Step 1: Convert speech to text using DeepSpeech
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)
 
# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file)
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Text: {spoken_text}")
 
# Step 2: Process visual input (e.g., face detection)
def detect_faces_in_image(image_path):
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)
    return len(faces)
 
# Example image input (replace with a valid image path)
image_path = "example_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image
face_count = detect_faces_in_image(image_path)
print(f"Number of Faces Detected: {face_count}")
 
# Step 3: Generate response based on spoken text and visual input (multi-modal processing)
response = dialogue_pipeline(f"User said: {spoken_text}. Detected {face_count} faces in the image.")
print(f"Dialogue Response: {response[0]['generated_text']}")
What This Does:
Speech-to-Text: Converts spoken language into text using DeepSpeech.

Visual Processing: Detects faces in an image using Haar Cascades for visual context.

Dialogue Generation: Generates a dialogue response based on both the spoken text and the visual context (number of faces detected).

Project 939. Multi-modal Reasoning System

A multi-modal reasoning system can make decisions or infer knowledge by combining information from multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. In this project, we simulate a simple multi-modal reasoning system that combines textual descriptions and visual content (images) to perform reasoning tasks, such as answering questions or making inferences.

Weâ€™ll use CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) for image-text reasoning and transformers for generating textual reasoning.

Step 1: Image-Text Reasoning
Weâ€™ll use CLIP to generate embeddings for both the image and text and compare their similarity to answer a question related to the image.

Step 2: Simple Question Answering (QA)
We will simulate a reasoning task where the model answers a question about the image using the textual context and visual content.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulate a question and an image dataset
image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")  # Replace with a valid image path
questions = ["What is the object in the image?", "Is this object a vehicle?", "What color is the object?"]
 
# Preprocess the image and text inputs
def multi_modal_reasoning(image, questions):
    inputs = processor(text=questions, images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
    # Perform forward pass to get model's prediction
    outputs = model(**inputs)
 
    # Calculate similarity between the image and each text question
    logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Image-text similarity scores
    probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)  # Convert logits to probabilities
 
    # Retrieve the most relevant question and answer
    best_match_idx = torch.argmax(probs)
    return questions[best_match_idx], probs[0][best_match_idx].item()
 
# Simulate reasoning task
best_question, match_score = multi_modal_reasoning(image, questions)
 
# Output the result
print(f"Image-Text Reasoning Result: {best_question}")
print(f"Match Score: {match_score:.2f}")
What This Does:
Image-Text Reasoning: We use CLIP to measure the similarity between an image and different textual descriptions/questions, answering which question is most relevant to the image.

Multi-modal Reasoning: The system combines text and visual features to reason about the content of the image.

Project 940. Multi-modal Few-shot Learning

Few-shot learning allows a model to generalize from a very small number of training examples. Multi-modal few-shot learning extends this concept by combining different modalities (e.g., text, image, audio) to enable a model to make predictions or decisions with minimal data from each modality.

In this project, we simulate a few-shot learning task by training a multi-modal model (using both images and text) to classify items based on just a few examples.

Step 1: Few-shot Learning on Image and Text
We use the CLIP model to create embeddings for both images and text. We then simulate a few-shot classification task where the model uses just a few examples to classify new items.

Step 2: Matching New Data
For this example, we simulate classifying an image of a dog using a few labeled examples (like "This is a dog" for text and an image of a dog).

Here's the Python implementation:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulated few-shot labeled data (image-text pairs)
few_shot_data = [
    {"image": "dog_image.jpg", "text": "This is a dog."},
    {"image": "cat_image.jpg", "text": "This is a cat."}
]
 
# Simulate new image to classify (replace with a valid image path)
new_image = Image.open("new_image.jpg")  # New image to classify (e.g., an image of a dog)
 
# Preprocess the few-shot text and images
few_shot_texts = [item['text'] for item in few_shot_data]
few_shot_images = [Image.open(item['image']) for item in few_shot_data]
inputs = processor(text=few_shot_texts, images=few_shot_images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Preprocess the new image for classification
new_image_input = processor(text=["What is this?"], images=[new_image], return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Perform forward pass for few-shot learning and classification
outputs = model(**inputs)
new_image_outputs = model(**new_image_input)
 
# Calculate similarity between new image and few-shot images
logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Image-text similarity scores for few-shot images
logits_new_image = new_image_outputs.logits_per_image  # Similarity score for new image
 
# Calculate cosine similarity between new image and few-shot images
similarity_scores = torch.cosine_similarity(logits_per_image, logits_new_image)
best_match_idx = torch.argmax(similarity_scores)
 
# Output the predicted class (text description) for the new image
predicted_class = few_shot_texts[best_match_idx]
print(f"Predicted Class for New Image: {predicted_class} with similarity score {similarity_scores[best_match_idx]:.2f}")
What This Does:
Few-shot Learning: The model learns from just a few labeled examples (images and text descriptions) to classify new data (an image of a dog, in this case).

Multi-modal Matching: Uses CLIP to create embeddings for both the images and texts and calculates the cosine similarity between the new image and the few-shot examples.

Prediction: The model predicts the class of the new image based on the closest match in the few-shot training data.

Project 941. Multi-modal Self-supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a type of unsupervised learning where the model learns useful representations from the data without relying on labeled data. Multi-modal self-supervised learning involves learning representations that combine information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio, without explicit supervision.

In this project, we simulate a multi-modal self-supervised learning task by training a model to learn representations from both text and image data. We'll use the CLIP model for self-supervised learning, where the model learns to correlate text and image features.

Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Weâ€™ll use a contrastive loss function (similar to what CLIP uses) to learn representations of both images and text.

Step 2: Self-supervised Learning
Instead of using labeled data, we train the model by comparing whether a text and an image belong together (positive pair) or not (negative pair).

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation using CLIP:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulate a dataset of image-text pairs (self-supervised task)
image_text_pairs = [
    {"image": "dog_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a dog."},
    {"image": "cat_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a cat."},
    {"image": "car_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a car."},
    {"image": "flower_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a flower."}
]
 
# Simulate a batch of text and image data for self-supervised learning
images = [Image.open(item['image']) for item in image_text_pairs]
texts = [item['text'] for item in image_text_pairs]
 
# Preprocess the images and text
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Perform a forward pass to get model's image-text embeddings
outputs = model(**inputs)
image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds
 
# Step 1: Contrastive loss function for self-supervised learning
def contrastive_loss(image_embeds, text_embeds, temperature=0.07):
    similarity_matrix = torch.matmul(image_embeds, text_embeds.T)
    labels = torch.arange(image_embeds.size(0)).to(image_embeds.device)
    loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(similarity_matrix / temperature, labels)
    return loss
 
# Step 2: Compute loss and simulate model optimization
loss = contrastive_loss(image_embeddings, text_embeddings)
print(f"Contrastive Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
 
# Simulate self-supervised learning (in practice, this would involve backpropagation and optimization)
# For this demo, we're just showing how loss is calculated for a batch of image-text pairs
What This Does:
Self-supervised Learning: The model learns to associate images and texts based on their similarity without any labeled data.

Contrastive Loss: We use a contrastive loss function to train the model to bring matching image-text pairs closer together and non-matching pairs farther apart in the embedding space.

Training Setup: This demo simulates how a model can be trained using self-supervised learning with image-text pairs.

Project 942. Multi-modal Transfer Learning

Multi-modal transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models from one modality (e.g., text or image) to enhance learning in another modality, often with less data. In this project, we simulate transfer learning across text and images using a pre-trained CLIP model. The model learns to transfer knowledge from one modality to another, allowing it to perform tasks such as image classification based on text or text generation based on image context.

Step 1: Pre-trained Model
We use the CLIP model for transfer learning across images and text. We'll first use it to get embeddings for both image and text data, and then apply the learned embeddings to a new task (e.g., image classification or text-based image retrieval).

Step 2: Fine-tuning for Transfer Learning
We simulate fine-tuning the model for a new task, such as classifying images into categories based on text prompts.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulate a dataset of image-text pairs for transfer learning
image_text_pairs = [
    {"image": "dog_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a dog."},
    {"image": "cat_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a cat."},
    {"image": "car_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a car."},
    {"image": "flower_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a flower."}
]
 
# Preprocess the image and text inputs
images = [Image.open(item['image']) for item in image_text_pairs]
texts = [item['text'] for item in image_text_pairs]
 
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Perform a forward pass to get model's image-text embeddings
outputs = model(**inputs)
image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds
 
# Step 1: Simulate fine-tuning by calculating similarity (using image-text contrastive loss)
def contrastive_loss(image_embeds, text_embeds, temperature=0.07):
    similarity_matrix = torch.matmul(image_embeds, text_embeds.T)
    labels = torch.arange(image_embeds.size(0)).to(image_embeds.device)
    loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(similarity_matrix / temperature, labels)
    return loss
 
# Step 2: Compute the loss and simulate transfer learning
loss = contrastive_loss(image_embeddings, text_embeddings)
print(f"Contrastive Loss for Transfer Learning: {loss.item():.4f}")
 
# Step 3: Transfer learning for new image classification task
# Simulate that we are transferring the knowledge from CLIP's learned embeddings to a new task:
# Example: Given a new image, classify it using the text-to-image embeddings
 
new_image = Image.open("new_image.jpg")  # Replace with a valid image path
new_texts = ["A picture of a dog.", "A picture of a cat.", "A picture of a car."]
 
# Process new data
new_inputs = processor(text=new_texts, images=[new_image] * len(new_texts), return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Forward pass through the model for classification
new_outputs = model(**new_inputs)
new_image_embeddings = new_outputs.image_embeds
new_text_embeddings = new_outputs.text_embeds
 
# Calculate similarity between new image and the text descriptions
similarity_scores = torch.cosine_similarity(new_image_embeddings, new_text_embeddings)
best_match_idx = torch.argmax(similarity_scores)
 
# Output the best match (classified label)
print(f"Predicted Class for New Image: {new_texts[best_match_idx]}")
What This Does:
Pre-trained Model: We use the CLIP model pre-trained on both text and images for transfer learning.

Contrastive Loss: We simulate fine-tuning by calculating a contrastive loss between image and text embeddings.

Transfer Learning: The model transfers knowledge from image-text matching to classify new images based on a few-shot learning approach.

Project 943. Multi-modal Domain Adaptation

Domain adaptation in multi-modal systems involves transferring a model trained on one domain to a different but related domain, adapting it to new data with minimal supervision. This allows the model to generalize across domains, such as applying a model trained on general images and text to a specialized domain like medical images or e-commerce.

In this project, we simulate multi-modal domain adaptation by adapting a pre-trained model to a new domain using image-text pairs. We'll focus on adapting a model trained on general datasets to work with a new domain (e.g., medical images or e-commerce product descriptions).

Step 1: Pre-trained Model
We'll use CLIP to learn general representations from a general domain (e.g., generic images and descriptions).

Step 2: Domain Adaptation
We simulate domain adaptation by fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a new domain (e.g., medical images and medical descriptions).

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image

print(f"Predicted Class for New Medical Image: {new_texts[best_match_idx]}")
What This Does:
Pre-trained CLIP Model: We simulate transfer from a general dataset (e.g., everyday images and text) to a new domain (e.g., medical images and text).

Domain Adaptation: We fine-tune the model on a new domain (medical data) using a contrastive loss function to align image-text representations from the new domain.

Prediction: After fine-tuning, the model can classify new images based on the adapted domain knowledge.

Project 944. Multi-modal Representation Learning

Multi-modal representation learning involves learning a unified representation space for multiple modalities (e.g., text, image, audio) that can be jointly used for downstream tasks such as classification, retrieval, or generation. In this project, we simulate the learning of shared representations from both images and texts using the CLIP model. The goal is to learn a combined representation that captures both image content and textual information in a common feature space.

Step 1: Learning Image and Text Representations
Weâ€™ll use CLIP to learn embeddings from both images and text and project them into a shared embedding space.

Step 2: Multi-modal Retrieval
After learning the representations, weâ€™ll retrieve relevant images based on text queries (and vice versa) by calculating similarities between the embeddings.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulated image-text dataset
image_text_pairs = [
    {"image": "dog_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a dog."},
    {"image": "cat_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a cat."},
    {"image": "car_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a car."},
    {"image": "flower_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a flower."}
]
 
# Step 1: Preprocess the image and text data to get embeddings
images = [Image.open(item['image']) for item in image_text_pairs]
texts = [item['text'] for item in image_text_pairs]
 
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Perform forward pass through the CLIP model to get image-text embeddings
outputs = model(**inputs)
image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds
 
# Step 2: Multi-modal Retrieval: Retrieve the most relevant image for a given text query
def retrieve_images_by_text_query(query, image_embeddings, text_embeddings, top_n=2):
    query_inputs = processor(text=[query] * len(image_embeddings), images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    query_outputs = model(**query_inputs)
    query_text_embeddings = query_outputs.text_embeds
 
    # Compute similarity between the query and image embeddings
    similarity_scores = torch.cosine_similarity(query_text_embeddings, image_embeddings)
    best_match_idx = torch.argsort(similarity_scores, descending=True)[:top_n]
 
    return [texts[i] for i in best_match_idx], [images[i] for i in best_match_idx]
 
# Example: Retrieve images based on a text query
query = "A picture of a dog"
retrieved_texts, retrieved_images = retrieve_images_by_text_query(query, image_embeddings, text_embeddings)
 
print(f"Text Query: {query}")
print(f"Most Relevant Texts: {retrieved_texts}")
print(f"Most Relevant Images: {retrieved_images}")
What This Does:
Image and Text Representation: The model CLIP processes both text and images and learns embeddings in a shared space.

Multi-modal Retrieval: It calculates the cosine similarity between the text query and image embeddings to retrieve the most relevant images for the query (and vice versa).

Multi-modal Alignment: The system learns a joint representation that enables comparison across modalities (text and images).

Project 945. Cross-modal Alignment Techniques

Cross-modal alignment techniques aim to map data from different modalities (such as text, images, audio) into a shared embedding space. The goal is to ensure that related data points (e.g., a text description and the corresponding image) are close together in the shared space, facilitating tasks like cross-modal retrieval, image captioning, and text-based image generation.

In this project, we will focus on aligning text and images using a contrastive loss function to ensure that related image-text pairs are aligned in a common feature space.

Step 1: Text and Image Embedding
We will use CLIP to get embeddings for both text and images.

Step 2: Cross-modal Alignment
We will compute the cosine similarity between text and image embeddings and use a contrastive loss function to align them in the shared space.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulated image-text dataset for cross-modal alignment
image_text_pairs = [
    {"image": "dog_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a dog."},
    {"image": "cat_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a cat."},
    {"image": "car_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a car."},
    {"image": "flower_image.jpg", "text": "A picture of a flower."}
]
 
# Step 1: Preprocess the image and text data to get embeddings
images = [Image.open(item['image']) for item in image_text_pairs]
texts = [item['text'] for item in image_text_pairs]
 
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# Perform forward pass through the CLIP model to get image-text embeddings
outputs = model(**inputs)
image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds
 
# Step 2: Cross-modal Alignment - Contrastive loss function to align image and text representations
def contrastive_loss(image_embeds, text_embeds, temperature=0.07):
    # Calculate similarity between image-text pairs
    similarity_matrix = torch.matmul(image_embeds, text_embeds.T)
    labels = torch.arange(image_embeds.size(0)).to(image_embeds.device)
    
    # Use cross-entropy loss to encourage correct alignment
    loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(similarity_matrix / temperature, labels)
    return loss
 
# Compute the contrastive loss for cross-modal alignment
loss = contrastive_loss(image_embeddings, text_embeddings)
print(f"Contrastive Loss for Cross-modal Alignment: {loss.item():.4f}")
 
# After alignment, we can perform cross-modal tasks like image-text retrieval:
def retrieve_images_from_text(query, image_embeddings, text_embeddings, top_n=2):
    query_inputs = processor(text=[query] * len(image_embeddings), images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    query_outputs = model(**query_inputs)
    query_text_embeddings = query_outputs.text_embeds
 
    # Compute similarity between the query and image embeddings
    similarity_scores = torch.cosine_similarity(query_text_embeddings, image_embeddings)
    best_match_idx = torch.argsort(similarity_scores, descending=True)[:top_n]
 
    return [texts[i] for i in best_match_idx], [images[i] for i in best_match_idx]
 
# Example: Retrieve images based on a text query
query = "A picture of a dog"
retrieved_texts, retrieved_images = retrieve_images_from_text(query, image_embeddings, text_embeddings)
 
print(f"Text Query: {query}")
print(f"Most Relevant Texts: {retrieved_texts}")
print(f"Most Relevant Images: {retrieved_images}")
What This Does:
Cross-modal Embedding: Uses CLIP to get embeddings for both images and texts.

Contrastive Loss: A contrastive loss function is used to align image-text pairs by minimizing the distance between embeddings of related image-text pairs and maximizing the distance for unrelated ones.

Cross-modal Retrieval: Retrieves the most relevant images based on a text query by calculating the cosine similarity between the text query's embedding and the image embeddings.

Project 946. Vision-Language Navigation

Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) systems use both visual and linguistic information to navigate an environment. In this project, we simulate a robotic navigation system that can understand natural language commands and visual cues (such as maps or images of rooms) to reach a target location.

We will use a pre-trained Vision-and-Language model (like CLIP) to process images and text instructions, then simulate the navigation based on a textual command and corresponding visual input.

Step 1: Image-Text Alignment
We will use CLIP to process both textual navigation instructions and room images to align visual and linguistic information.

Step 2: Navigation Simulation
We simulate a navigation task where the model uses textual descriptions to match them to images of different rooms.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Simulate a dataset of room images and text instructions
room_data = [
    {"image": "living_room.jpg", "text": "Go to the living room."},
    {"image": "kitchen.jpg", "text": "Go to the kitchen."},
    {"image": "bathroom.jpg", "text": "Go to the bathroom."},
    {"image": "bedroom.jpg", "text": "Go to the bedroom."}
]
 
# Preprocess the images and text data
images = [Image.open(item['image']) for item in room_data]
texts = [item['text'] for item in room_data]
 
# Step 1: Process text and images for alignment using CLIP
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
outputs = model(**inputs)
 
# Step 2: Calculate similarity between the navigation command and room images
image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds
 
def navigate_to_room(query, image_embeddings, text_embeddings, top_n=1):
    query_inputs = processor(text=[query] * len(image_embeddings), images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    query_outputs = model(**query_inputs)
    query_text_embeddings = query_outputs.text_embeds
 
    # Calculate cosine similarity between the query and image embeddings
    similarity_scores = torch.cosine_similarity(query_text_embeddings, image_embeddings)
    best_match_idx = torch.argsort(similarity_scores, descending=True)[:top_n]
 
    return [texts[i] for i in best_match_idx], [images[i] for i in best_match_idx]
 
# Example: Navigate to a specific room based on text instruction
query = "Go to the kitchen."
retrieved_texts, retrieved_images = navigate_to_room(query, image_embeddings, text_embeddings)
 
print(f"Navigation Command: {query}")
print(f"Most Relevant Room: {retrieved_texts}")
print(f"Corresponding Image: {retrieved_images}")
What This Does:
Text and Image Alignment: Uses the CLIP model to align both text (navigation instructions) and images (room images) in a shared embedding space.

Cosine Similarity: Calculates the cosine similarity between the input text (navigation command) and the available room images to determine which room matches the instruction.

Navigation Task: Retrieves the most relevant room based on a text query, simulating the navigation process.

Project 947. Audio-Visual Navigation

Audio-Visual Navigation systems combine auditory and visual inputs to guide users or robots in an environment. These systems process speech commands and visual scenes (such as room layouts or objects) to perform navigation tasks, making them useful in environments where text or traditional control interfaces are not available.

In this project, we simulate audio-visual navigation by combining speech recognition for instructions (e.g., "Go to the door") and object detection for visual cues (e.g., recognizing a door in the room).

Step 1: Speech Recognition
We use DeepSpeech to transcribe spoken instructions into text.

Step 2: Visual Scene Understanding
We use OpenCV and Haar Cascades for object detection (e.g., detecting a door in a room).

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
import torch
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
 
# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor for visual scene understanding
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)
 
# Simulated audio input for speech commands
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Command: {spoken_text}")
 
# Function to detect objects in the visual scene (e.g., doors, chairs)
def detect_objects_in_image(image_path):
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')  # For demo purposes, using face detection
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
    detected_objects = []
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        detected_objects.append("Face")
        cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)  # Draw rectangle around detected object
    cv2.imwrite("output_image.jpg", img)
    Image.open("output_image.jpg").show()
    return detected_objects
 
# Simulated image input (replace with a valid image path)
image_path = "room_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image path
objects_in_scene = detect_objects_in_image(image_path)
print(f"Detected Objects: {objects_in_scene}")
 
# Step 3: Combine audio command with visual scene understanding for navigation
def navigate_based_on_audio_and_visual(spoken_text, detected_objects):
    if "door" in spoken_text.lower() and "Face" in detected_objects:
        print("Navigating to the door...")
    elif "door" in spoken_text.lower():
        print("The door is not visible, please adjust your view.")
    else:
        print("Command unclear. Please specify a direction or object.")
 
# Combine audio and visual inputs for navigation decision-making
navigate_based_on_audio_and_visual(spoken_text, objects_in_scene)
What This Does:
Speech Recognition: Uses DeepSpeech to convert spoken instructions into text.

Visual Scene Understanding: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascades to detect objects (like faces or doors) in the image. In real-world applications, you would use more sophisticated models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN for better accuracy in object detection.

Audio-Visual Navigation: Combines the speech command (e.g., "Go to the door") with visual recognition (e.g., detecting a door) to decide on navigation actions (e.g., whether to proceed to the door or adjust the camera angle).

Project 948. Multi-modal Action Recognition

Multi-modal action recognition systems analyze both visual (e.g., video frames) and audio (e.g., speech or background sounds) data to detect and classify actions or events. These systems are widely used in surveillance, sports analytics, human-computer interaction, and video content analysis.

In this project, we simulate multi-modal action recognition by using video frames and audio features to recognize actions. We'll use OpenCV for video processing and librosa for audio feature extraction.

Step 1: Video Action Recognition
We'll use OpenCV to extract frames from the video and detect actions (e.g., person walking, running).

Step 2: Audio Action Recognition
We'll use librosa to extract audio features (e.g., pitch, tempo) and perform basic event detection based on the audio.

Step 3: Action Classification
We'll combine visual features from the video frames and audio features to classify actions.

Here's the Python implementation:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import librosa
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor for visual features
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Step 1: Action Recognition from Video (using OpenCV for video frames)
def recognize_action_from_video(video_file):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
    frame_count = 0
    actions = []
 
    while True:
        success, frame = cap.read()
        if not success:
            break
 
        # Simple action recognition (e.g., detect movement or actions)
        # For this example, we just classify frames as "person walking", "person sitting", etc.
        if frame_count % 50 == 0:  # Simulate action detection every 50 frames
            actions.append("Person Walking")
        frame_count += 1
 
    cap.release()
    return actions
 
# Step 2: Action Recognition from Audio (using librosa)
def recognize_action_from_audio(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file)
    tempo, _ = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr)
 
    # Basic action detection based on tempo (simplified logic)
    if tempo > 120:
        return "Running"
    else:
        return "Walking"
 
# Example inputs
video_file = "example_video.mp4"  # Replace with a valid video path
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
 
# Step 1: Detect actions from video
video_actions = recognize_action_from_video(video_file)
print(f"Actions detected from video: {video_actions}")
 
# Step 2: Detect actions from audio
audio_action = recognize_action_from_audio(audio_file)
print(f"Action detected from audio: {audio_action}")
 
# Step 3: Combine visual and audio actions for final classification
if "Person Walking" in video_actions and audio_action == "Walking":
    print("Final Action: Walking")
elif "Person Walking" in video_actions and audio_action == "Running":
    print("Final Action: Running")
else:
    print("Action classification unclear.")
What This Does:
Video Action Recognition: Uses OpenCV to process video frames, simulating action detection (e.g., recognizing a walking person). In a real-world system, you would use more sophisticated models (like RNNs, CNNs, or transformers) to analyze movement and detect complex actions.

Audio Action Recognition: Uses librosa to extract features like tempo from the audio and classify actions (e.g., walking or running) based on the audioâ€™s rhythm.

Action Classification: Combines both audio and visual information to classify the action more accurately (e.g., "Walking" if both the video and audio suggest the same).

Project 949. Multi-modal Scene Understanding

Multi-modal scene understanding systems integrate both visual and textual data to understand and interpret complex scenes. For example, in a video or image, the system can detect objects, actions, and relationships between elements and generate descriptive captions or answer questions about the scene.

In this project, we will simulate scene understanding by combining object detection (from visual inputs) and textual descriptions to analyze a scene.

Step 1: Object Detection
We will use OpenCV and Haar Cascades for object detection (for simplicity, we detect faces, but in a real system, you would use more sophisticated models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN for detecting more diverse objects).

Step 2: Textual Scene Analysis
We will use a pre-trained transformer model (like BERT or T5) for analyzing text-based descriptions of the scene to understand relationships between objects and generate high-level summaries.

Step 3: Multi-modal Scene Understanding
We combine both visual object detection and textual analysis to generate a comprehensive description of the scene.

Here's the Python implementation:

import cv2
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained transformer model for scene analysis (text processing)
scene_analyzer = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
 
# Step 1: Object Detection using OpenCV (simplified with face detection for demo)
def detect_objects_in_image(image_path):
    # Load Haar Cascade for face detection
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)
    
    detected_objects = []
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        detected_objects.append("Face")
        cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)  # Draw rectangle around face
    
    # Save and display the image
    cv2.imwrite("output_image.jpg", img)
    Image.open("output_image.jpg").show()
    
    return detected_objects
 
# Step 2: Text-based Scene Analysis (using zero-shot classification)
def analyze_scene_description(scene_text):
    possible_labels = ["indoor", "outdoor", "portrait", "action", "crowd", "nature"]
    result = scene_analyzer(scene_text, candidate_labels=possible_labels)
    return result
 
# Example inputs
image_path = "room_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image path
scene_text = "There are people sitting in the living room, and a cat is on the sofa."
 
# Step 1: Detect objects in the image (e.g., faces, objects)
detected_objects = detect_objects_in_image(image_path)
print(f"Detected Objects: {detected_objects}")
 
# Step 2: Analyze scene description using zero-shot classification
scene_analysis = analyze_scene_description(scene_text)
print(f"Scene Analysis: {scene_analysis['labels'][0]} (Confidence: {scene_analysis['scores'][0]:.2f})")
 
# Step 3: Combine visual and textual understanding for scene comprehension
final_scene_understanding = f"Detected Objects: {detected_objects}\nScene Analysis: {scene_analysis['labels'][0]}"
print(f"Final Scene Understanding: {final_scene_understanding}")
What This Does:
Object Detection: Uses OpenCV and Haar Cascades to detect objects (e.g., faces) in the image. In a real-world system, you would use advanced models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN for detecting a variety of objects.

Textual Scene Understanding: Uses zero-shot classification (via BART) to analyze the textual description of the scene and classify it into predefined categories (e.g., indoor, outdoor, nature).

Scene Interpretation: Combines both visual object detection and textual scene analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of the scene.

Project 950. Multi-modal Fake News Detection

Multi-modal fake news detection systems use both textual and visual cues to determine whether news content is authentic or fake. These systems combine linguistic features (from the text) and visual features (from images or videos) to improve the accuracy of fake news classification.

In this project, we simulate multi-modal fake news detection by analyzing textual content (e.g., articles or headlines) and visual content (e.g., images associated with the news) to classify the news as fake or real.

Step 1: Textual Feature Extraction
We will use BERT (or another transformer-based model) for text classification to analyze whether the content is likely to be fake or real.

Step 2: Visual Feature Extraction
We will use CLIP to analyze whether the associated image matches the claims in the text (e.g., does the image support the narrative, or is it misleading?).

Step 3: Multi-modal Fake News Classification
We combine both text and image features to perform fake news classification.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import pipeline, CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
 
# Load pre-trained BERT model for text classification (fake news detection)
fake_news_classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="bert-base-uncased")
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor for image analysis
clip_model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
clip_processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Step 1: Fake News Classification from Text
def classify_fake_news_from_text(text):
    result = fake_news_classifier(text)
    return result[0]['label']
 
# Step 2: Visual Mismatch Detection using CLIP
def analyze_image_and_text(text, image_path):
    # Load image and process with CLIP
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    inputs = clip_processor(text=[text], images=[image], return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    
    # Perform forward pass to get image-text embeddings
    outputs = clip_model(**inputs)
    image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
    text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds
 
    # Calculate similarity between the text and image embeddings
    similarity_score = torch.cosine_similarity(text_embeddings, image_embeddings)
    return similarity_score.item()
 
# Example inputs
news_text = "The recent viral video shows a protest in downtown, claiming that the government is corrupt."
image_path = "fake_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image path
 
# Step 1: Classify fake news based on text
news_classification = classify_fake_news_from_text(news_text)
print(f"News Classification (Text-based): {news_classification}")
 
# Step 2: Analyze image-text consistency using CLIP
image_text_similarity = analyze_image_and_text(news_text, image_path)
print(f"Image-Text Similarity Score: {image_text_similarity:.2f}")
 
# Step 3: Fake News Decision based on both modalities
if news_classification == "LABEL_1" and image_text_similarity < 0.5:
    print("Conclusion: Fake news detected based on text and image inconsistency.")
else:
    print("Conclusion: News seems authentic.")
What This Does:
Textual Analysis: Uses a pre-trained BERT model to classify the news text as fake or real based on linguistic features.

Visual Analysis: Uses CLIP to check the consistency between the text and the associated image. A low similarity score between the text and image may indicate image manipulation or misleading visuals, which could suggest fake news.

Multi-modal Classification: Combines the results from both the text classifier and image similarity to classify the news as fake or real.

Project 951. Audio-Visual Synchronization

Audio-Visual Synchronization systems align audio and visual signals in a manner that allows them to be processed together. These systems are commonly used in applications like lip-syncing, speech-driven animation, and video editing. The goal is to match audio (speech, sound) with the corresponding visual elements (e.g., lip movements or gestures) for coherent and synchronized multimedia content.

In this project, we simulate audio-visual synchronization by matching speech with lip movements in a video. Weâ€™ll use speech-to-text (via DeepSpeech) for audio transcription and OpenCV for visual feature extraction (specifically, lip movements).

Step 1: Audio Transcription
We use DeepSpeech to transcribe the spoken content from the audio file.

Step 2: Lip Movement Detection
We use OpenCV to detect lip movements in video frames (simplified using face detection for demo purposes).

Step 3: Synchronization
We calculate the synchronization between audio (text and speech tempo) and visual features (lip movement speed and alignment).

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
import torch
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
 
# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor for visual analysis (optional for advanced sync)
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Step 1: Convert audio to text using DeepSpeech
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)
 
# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file)
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Text: {spoken_text}")
 
# Step 2: Lip movement detection using OpenCV (simplified with face detection)
def detect_lip_movement_in_video(video_path):
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    lip_movements = []
 
    while True:
        success, frame = cap.read()
        if not success:
            break
        
        # Convert to grayscale for face detection
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
 
        for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
            # Here we simplify by assuming that lips are in the lower part of the face
            lip_region = frame[y + int(h / 2):y + h, x:x + w]
            lip_movements.append(lip_region)  # Store lip region for analysis (simplified)
 
    cap.release()
    return lip_movements
 
# Example video input (replace with a valid video path)
video_file = "example_video.mp4"
lip_movements = detect_lip_movement_in_video(video_file)
print(f"Lip Movements Detected: {len(lip_movements)} frames")
 
# Step 3: Sync audio with visual lip movements
# Here we simulate basic synchronization by checking if the speech matches the lip movement count
def synchronize_audio_and_visual(spoken_text, lip_movements):
    audio_length = len(spoken_text.split())  # Approximate the length by word count
    video_length = len(lip_movements)  # Number of frames with detected lips
    
    # Calculate the ratio of audio to visual content
    sync_ratio = audio_length / video_length
    print(f"Synchronization Ratio (Audio to Visual): {sync_ratio:.2f}")
    
    # Check if audio and video lengths are reasonably synchronized
    if abs(sync_ratio - 1) < 0.1:
        print("Audio and Video are well synchronized.")
    else:
        print("Audio and Video are not synchronized.")
 
# Example: Synchronize audio with visual lip movements
synchronize_audio_and_visual(spoken_text, lip_movements)
What This Does:
Audio Transcription: Uses DeepSpeech to convert speech from the audio file into text.

Lip Movement Detection: Uses OpenCV to detect lip movements in video frames (simulated with face detection).

Synchronization: Compares the audio and visual components based on their length and timing to determine if they are synchronized.

Project 952. Speech-driven Animation

Speech-driven animation involves generating facial animations (or full-body animations) based on speech input. This technique is widely used in virtual assistants, animated characters, and synthetic speech applications, where the character's mouth and facial movements sync with the spoken words.

In this project, we simulate speech-driven facial animation by analyzing audio speech and generating corresponding mouth movements (or facial animations). Weâ€™ll use speech-to-text (via DeepSpeech) for extracting the words from the audio, and then generate a basic animation (e.g., lip-syncing) based on the transcribed text.

Step 1: Speech-to-Text
We use DeepSpeech to convert speech from the audio file into text.

Step 2: Lip Movement Generation
We will simulate basic lip syncing by matching phonemes (speech sounds) to corresponding mouth shapes (visemes). This can be done through a simplified model, but in a real system, LipNet or other advanced models for viseme prediction would be used.

Step 3: Mouth Animation
For this simplified version, we can display a basic lip-sync animation using OpenCV by changing the mouth shape based on phoneme sequences.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
 
# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Simulated mapping of phonemes to visemes (simplified)

    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)
 
# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file)
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Text: {spoken_text}")
 
# Step 1: Basic Lip Sync Animation Generation
def generate_lip_sync_animation(spoken_text):
    # Split the spoken text into words (for simplicity, we assume phoneme-to-viseme mapping is word-based)
    words = spoken_text.split()
    visemes = []
 
    # Convert each word to its corresponding viseme (this is a simplified approach)
    for word in words:
        for phoneme, viseme in phoneme_to_viseme.items():
            if phoneme in word.upper():  # Check if phoneme is in the word
                visemes.append(viseme)
                break
 
    # Step 2: Generate lip-sync animation (simplified)
    # Create a blank canvas for animation
    canvas = np.ones((400, 600, 3), dtype=np.uint8) * 255  # White background
 
    # Simulate mouth animation based on visemes
    for viseme in visemes:
        canvas.fill(255)  # Clear canvas
        # Draw different shapes based on the viseme
        if viseme == "mouth_open":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (50, 25), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_round":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 40), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_smile":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 25), 0, 0, 180, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_open_narrow":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 15), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
 
        # Display the simulated lip-sync frame
        cv2.imshow("Mouth Animation", canvas)
        cv2.waitKey(200)  # Display each frame for 200 ms
 
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
 
# Step 3: Create animation from spoken text
generate_lip_sync_animation(spoken_text)
What This Does:
Speech-to-Text: Converts speech to text using DeepSpeech, so we know what words are being spoken.

Phoneme to Viseme Mapping: Maps phonemes (speech sounds) to corresponding mouth shapes (visemes).

Mouth Animation: Simulates lip-sync by displaying different mouth shapes for corresponding phonemes.

Project 953. Talking Head Generation

Talking Head Generation involves generating realistic facial animations or video clips of a person speaking based on speech input. This project combines audio-to-text and face generation to create a realistic animated head that mimics the speech content. This is particularly useful in applications such as virtual assistants, character animation, and language learning systems.

In this project, we simulate talking head generation by combining audio (speech) with face animation. Weâ€™ll use DeepSpeech for speech-to-text conversion and create a simple animated face based on the text. In real-world applications, models like Wav2Lip would be used to generate mouth movements that synchronize with the speech.

Step 1: Speech-to-Text Conversion
We use DeepSpeech to convert speech into text.

Step 2: Facial Animation
We simulate basic facial animation based on lip-syncing. This involves mapping the phonemes (speech sounds) to corresponding mouth shapes (visemes).

Step 3: Talking Head Generation
Using the phoneme-to-viseme mapping, we generate basic mouth movements that align with the spoken words. We can simulate a simple head model using OpenCV.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

# Step 3: Create animation from spoken text
generate_talking_head_animation(spoken_text)
What This Does:
Speech-to-Text: Converts speech to text using DeepSpeech, so we know what words are being spoken.

Phoneme to Viseme Mapping: Maps phonemes (speech sounds) to corresponding mouth shapes (visemes).

Mouth Animation: Simulates lip-sync by displaying different mouth shapes based on phoneme sequences.

Project 954. Gesture Generation from Speech

Gesture generation from speech refers to creating realistic gestures (e.g., hand movements, body language) based on spoken words. This is particularly useful in applications like virtual assistants, interactive avatars, and robotic systems where speech is accompanied by gestures to make communication more natural and engaging.

In this project, we simulate gesture generation by mapping speech (or text) to corresponding gestures using a rule-based approach. In real-world systems, deep learning models can be used to generate more sophisticated gesture sequences.

Step 1: Speech-to-Text Conversion
We use DeepSpeech to convert speech into text.

Step 2: Gesture Generation
We simulate gesture generation by associating certain text keywords (or speech components) with predefined gestures. For instance, certain phrases might correspond to hand waving, nodding, or head shaking.

Step 3: Gesture Animation
We can use OpenCV to simulate basic gesture animations like hand movements or head gestures.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
import random
 
# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):

    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)
 
# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file)
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Text: {spoken_text}")
 
# Step 1: Simulated Gesture Generation based on Speech Text
def generate_gesture_from_speech(spoken_text):
    # Define simple mapping of text to gestures (simplified example)
    gestures = {
        "hello": "wave_hand",
        "thank you": "nod_head",
        "goodbye": "wave_hand",
        "angry": "clenched_fist",
        "happy": "raise_both_hands"
    }
 
    # Map spoken words to gestures (this is a simple keyword-based approach)
    gesture = "no_gesture"  # Default no gesture
    for word in gestures:
        if word in spoken_text.lower():
            gesture = gestures[word]
            break
 
    return gesture
 
# Step 2: Simulate Gesture Animation (for demo purposes, just draw basic shapes)
def simulate_gesture(gesture):
    # Create a blank canvas for gesture animation
    canvas = np.ones((400, 400, 3), dtype=np.uint8) * 255  # White background
 
    # Simulate different gestures with shapes
    if gesture == "wave_hand":
        cv2.ellipse(canvas, (200, 250), (50, 100), 0, 0, 180, (0, 0, 0), -1)
    elif gesture == "nod_head":
        cv2.ellipse(canvas, (200, 150), (80, 80), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
    elif gesture == "clenched_fist":
        cv2.rectangle(canvas, (150, 200), (250, 300), (0, 0, 0), -1)
    elif gesture == "raise_both_hands":
        cv2.rectangle(canvas, (100, 100), (150, 300), (0, 0, 0), -1)
        cv2.rectangle(canvas, (250, 100), (300, 300), (0, 0, 0), -1)
 
    # Display the gesture animation
    cv2.imshow("Gesture Animation", canvas)
    cv2.waitKey(1000)  # Display each gesture for 1 second
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
 
# Step 3: Generate gesture and simulate animation
gesture = generate_gesture_from_speech(spoken_text)
print(f"Generated Gesture: {gesture}")
simulate_gesture(gesture)
What This Does:
Speech-to-Text: Converts speech into text using DeepSpeech.

Gesture Generation: Generates a gesture based on keywords or phrases in the spoken text (e.g., "hello" maps to "wave_hand").

Gesture Animation: Simulates the corresponding gesture (e.g., waving or nodding) using OpenCV by drawing shapes.

Project 955. Face-Voice Matching System

A Face-Voice Matching System is designed to match an individual's face to their voice, which can be applied in scenarios such as identity verification or security systems. The system uses both facial features (from an image) and speech features (from an audio clip) to verify if both the face and voice belong to the same person.

In this project, we simulate face-voice matching by extracting facial features from an image and voice features from an audio clip. We then compute their similarity using deep learning models or simple feature comparison techniques.

Step 1: Facial Feature Extraction
We use OpenCV for face detection and face recognition.

Step 2: Voice Feature Extraction
We use DeepSpeech to convert speech into text and extract acoustic features (like pitch and tempo) for matching.

Step 3: Matching Face and Voice
We combine face features and voice features to compute the similarity score.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
 
# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)

# Step 1: Face recognition using OpenCV
def extract_face_features(image_path):
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
 
    if len(faces) == 0:
        return None  # No face detected
 
    # Simplified: Just extract features from the first detected face
    (x, y, w, h) = faces[0]
    face_region = image[y:y + h, x:x + w]
    face_features = np.mean(face_region)  # Simple average intensity as feature (can be improved with deep models)
    return face_features
 
# Step 2: Extract speech features
def extract_voice_features(audio_file):
    spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
    # Here, we simply use text length and pitch as a proxy for voice features (in real systems, more features like MFCC are used)
    text_length = len(spoken_text.split())
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    pitch = np.mean(audio)  # Simplified feature: average amplitude (for demo purposes)
    return np.array([text_length, pitch])
 
# Step 3: Compare face and voice features
def compare_face_and_voice(image_path, audio_file):
    face_features = extract_face_features(image_path)
    voice_features = extract_voice_features(audio_file)
    
    if face_features is None:
        return "Face not detected in the image."
    
    # Compute similarity (cosine similarity for demonstration)
    similarity_score = cosine_similarity([face_features], [voice_features])
    return similarity_score[0][0]
 
# Example inputs
image_path = "person_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image path
audio_file = "person_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
 
# Step 4: Perform face and voice matching
similarity_score = compare_face_and_voice(image_path, audio_file)
print(f"Face-Voice Similarity Score: {similarity_score:.2f}")
 
# Final decision based on similarity score
if similarity_score > 0.7:
    print("Face and voice match, likely same person.")
else:
    print("Face and voice do not match, different person.")
What This Does:
Facial Feature Extraction: Detects a face in the image using OpenCV Haar cascades and extracts simple features (e.g., average intensity).

Voice Feature Extraction: Converts speech into text using DeepSpeech and extracts basic features like text length and pitch as proxies for voice features.

Matching Face and Voice: Compares the extracted features using cosine similarity to determine if the face and voice belong to the same person.

Project 956. Cross-modal Biometric Verification

Cross-modal biometric verification is the process of verifying an individualâ€™s identity using data from multiple modalities, such as face recognition, voice recognition, and even fingerprints or iris scans. In this project, we simulate cross-modal biometric verification by combining facial features and voice features to verify if they belong to the same person.

In this implementation, we will use facial features from images and voice features from audio to compare the personâ€™s identity, simulating a cross-modal verification process.

Step 1: Facial Feature Extraction
We will use OpenCV to extract basic facial features from images.

Step 2: Voice Feature Extraction
We will use DeepSpeech to extract speech features (such as text length and pitch) from audio.

Step 3: Cross-modal Verification
We will compare both facial and voice features to verify whether they match or not.

What This Does:
Facial Feature Extraction: Extracts facial features from an image using OpenCV's Haar cascades. In real-world systems, you would use deep learning-based models (like FaceNet) for more accurate and robust face embeddings.

Voice Feature Extraction: Extracts speech features (text length and pitch) from the audio using DeepSpeech. More advanced systems would use MFCCs or Wav2Vec embeddings for voice feature extraction.

Cross-modal Verification: Compares face features and voice features using cosine similarity to determine if they belong to the same person.

Project 957. Multi-modal Health Monitoring

Multi-modal health monitoring combines multiple types of data (such as text, images, audio, and sensor data) to monitor and assess an individualâ€™s health. By integrating different modalities, the system can provide more comprehensive and accurate health assessments, including remote monitoring of chronic conditions, mental health analysis, and physical well-being.

In this project, we simulate multi-modal health monitoring using audio (e.g., a personâ€™s voice or speech), text (e.g., health records or reports), and image data (e.g., medical images or images of patients) to assess the overall health condition.

Step 1: Text-Based Health Monitoring
We use NLP models to analyze health reports or patient descriptions to detect potential health issues.

Step 2: Speech-Based Health Monitoring
We use DeepSpeech for speech-to-text conversion and analyze features like voice pitch and tone that may suggest conditions such as stress or fatigue.

Step 3: Image-Based Health Monitoring
We use OpenCV or deep learning models (like CLIP) for analyzing medical images (such as X-rays or skin lesions) to detect potential conditions.

Step 4: Multi-modal Health Assessment
We combine insights from text, audio, and images to make a holistic health assessment.

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
from transformers import pipeline
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
 
# Load pre-trained DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")
 
# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)
 
# Step 1: Text-based health report analysis using NLP (simple health check)
def analyze_health_report(text):
    health_analyzer = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
    possible_labels = ["diabetes", "heart disease", "fatigue", "stress", "healthy", "overweight"]
    result = health_analyzer(text, candidate_labels=possible_labels)
    return result
 
# Step 2: Voice-based health monitoring (detecting stress or fatigue)
def analyze_voice_health(audio_file):
    spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
    text_length = len(spoken_text.split())
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    pitch = np.mean(audio)  # Simplified feature: average amplitude (for demo purposes)
    
    # Use pitch and text length to assess fatigue or stress
    if pitch > 0.05 and text_length < 50:  # Simulated rule (low text, high pitch = stress)
        return "Stress Detected"
    elif text_length > 100:
        return "No Stress"
    else:
        return "Fatigue Possible"
 
# Step 3: Image-based health monitoring (detecting medical conditions from images)
def analyze_health_image(image_path):
    # Load and process image (for demo, we'll just use face detection for stress or fatigue symptoms)
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)
    
    if len(faces) == 0:
        return "No symptoms detected"
    else:
        return "Facial features detected, potential stress signs"
 
# Step 4: Combine text, audio, and image results for multi-modal health assessment
def multi_modal_health_assessment(text, audio_file, image_path):
    # Text-based health report analysis
    text_health = analyze_health_report(text)
    print(f"Text-Based Health Report: {text_health['labels'][0]} (Confidence: {text_health['scores'][0]:.2f})")
    
    # Voice-based health monitoring (stress/fatigue detection)
    voice_health = analyze_voice_health(audio_file)
    print(f"Voice-Based Health Monitoring: {voice_health}")
    
    # Image-based health monitoring (face detection for stress/fatigue)
    image_health = analyze_health_image(image_path)
    print(f"Image-Based Health Monitoring: {image_health}")
 
    # Combine the results to make a final health assessment
    if "stress" in text_health['labels'][0].lower() or voice_health == "Stress Detected":
        final_assessment = "Stress Detected - Recommend rest and relaxation."
    elif image_health == "Facial features detected, potential stress signs":
        final_assessment = "Stress or fatigue detected - Recommend medical attention."
    else:
        final_assessment = "Healthy - Continue regular health practices."
 
    print(f"Final Health Assessment: {final_assessment}")
 
# Example inputs
health_report_text = "The patient reports feeling very fatigued and stressed due to a busy schedule."
audio_file = "patient_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
image_path = "patient_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image file
 
# Step 5: Perform multi-modal health assessment
multi_modal_health_assessment(health_report_text, audio_file, image_path)
What This Does:
Text-based Health Report Analysis: Analyzes the health report text to detect potential conditions (e.g., diabetes, stress, fatigue) using zero-shot classification.

Voice-based Health Monitoring: Analyzes the audio to detect signs of stress or fatigue based on the speech pitch and text length.

Image-based Health Monitoring: Uses OpenCV to detect facial features and assess potential stress or fatigue based on visual cues.

Multi-modal Health Assessment: Combines the results from text, audio, and image to provide a comprehensive health evaluation.

Project 958. Audio-Visual Source Separation

Audio-Visual Source Separation refers to the process of isolating individual sources of sound or objects from audio and visual input. For example, in a video where multiple people are talking or different sounds are occurring, the goal is to separate the audio for each speaker or sound source based on the visual cues (e.g., which speakerâ€™s face corresponds to which voice).

This technique can be applied to scenarios such as multi-speaker environments, video conferencing, or noise reduction where both audio and visual data are used to separate sources.

Step 1: Audio Separation
We use a simple audio separation technique based on voice activity detection (VAD) to detect speech segments and separate them.

Step 2: Visual Source Separation
We will use OpenCV for face detection to match each voice activity to the corresponding speaker in the video.

Step 3: Audio-Visual Matching
We combine both audio and visual features to map the detected speakers (faces) with the corresponding audio segments.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import librosa
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play
 
# Step 1: Audio Separation using simple Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
def separate_audio_sources(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, sr=None)
    
    # Basic Voice Activity Detection (simplified)
    onset_env = librosa.onset.onset_strength(y=y, sr=sr)
    peaks = librosa.onset.onset_detect(onset_envelope=onset_env, sr=sr, units='time')
    
    # Create segments based on detected peaks
    segments = []
    for i in range(len(peaks) - 1):
        start = int(peaks[i] * sr)
        end = int(peaks[i + 1] * sr)
        segments.append((start, end))
    
    return segments
 
# Step 2: Visual Source Separation (Face Detection for speaker matching)
def detect_faces_in_video(video_file):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    
    face_frames = []
    frame_count = 0
    
    while True:
        success, frame = cap.read()
        if not success:
            break
        
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
        
        if len(faces) > 0:
            face_frames.append(frame_count)  # Store the frame numbers with detected faces
        
        frame_count += 1
 
    cap.release()
    return face_frames
 
# Step 3: Combine Audio and Visual Source Separation
def separate_audio_and_visual_sources(audio_file, video_file):
    # Step 1: Separate audio based on voice activity detection
    audio_segments = separate_audio_sources(audio_file)
    print(f"Detected audio segments: {audio_segments}")
 
    # Step 2: Detect faces in the video
    face_frames = detect_faces_in_video(video_file)
    print(f"Frames with detected faces: {face_frames}")
    
    # Step 3: Match audio segments with faces (simplified)
    # For simplicity, assume that audio segments correspond to faces in video frames directly.
    # In real applications, we can use lip sync models or speaker recognition for more accurate matching.
    if len(audio_segments) > len(face_frames):
        print("More audio segments than faces detected.")
    else:
        for i in range(len(audio_segments)):
            print(f"Audio Segment {i + 1} (from {audio_segments[i][0]} to {audio_segments[i][1]}) matched to Face in Frame {face_frames[i]}.")
 
# Example inputs
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
video_file = "example_video.mp4"  # Replace with a valid video file
 
# Perform audio-visual source separation
separate_audio_and_visual_sources(audio_file, video_file)
What This Does:
Audio Separation: It detects speech segments in the audio using onset detection with librosa. This is a simple method for detecting changes in audio that might correspond to speech events.

Visual Source Separation: It detects faces in the video using OpenCV's Haar Cascades for face detection. In practice, more advanced methods (e.g., YOLO or DeepFace) can be used for detecting multiple faces.

Audio-Visual Matching: It pairs the detected audio segments with the faces in the video, simulating how one might synchronize the speech with the corresponding speaker in the video. The matching is done based on frame numbers and audio events.

Project 959. Multi-modal Reinforcement Learning

Multi-modal Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves learning from interactions with an environment using multiple modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, textual information). In this project, we simulate an RL agent that learns how to perform tasks by processing inputs from multiple modalities, such as images (vision) and text (instructions or feedback). The agent learns to maximize a reward signal using information from these different modalities.

In this project, weâ€™ll build a simple multi-modal RL agent that receives both visual input (images) and textual input (commands or feedback). Weâ€™ll use a basic reinforcement learning setup and train the agent to perform tasks based on these multi-modal inputs.

Step 1: Visual Input (Images)
The agent uses images of the environment to make decisions.

Step 2: Text Input (Instructions/Feedback)
The agent uses text (e.g., commands or feedback) to understand how to interact with the environment.

Step 3: Reinforcement Learning Setup
Weâ€™ll simulate a basic RL setup where the agent receives a reward based on its actions and updates its policy accordingly. The reward signal will be influenced by both the visual and textual inputs.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import numpy as np
import random
import cv2
from transformers import pipeline
 
# Simulated environment: The agent will try to reach a target location based on visual and text input.
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(10, 10))  # 10x10 grid environment (0: empty, 1: target)
        self.agent_position = (random.randint(0, 9), random.randint(0, 9))  # Agent's starting position
        self.target_position = (random.randint(0, 9), random.randint(0, 9))  # Random target position
    
    def reset(self):
        self.agent_position = (random.randint(0, 9), random.randint(0, 9))
        return self.agent_position
    
    def step(self, action):
        # Simulate agent movement based on action (up, down, left, right)
        x, y = self.agent_position
        if action == 0:  # Move up
            x = max(x - 1, 0)
        elif action == 1:  # Move down
            x = min(x + 1, 9)
        elif action == 2:  # Move left
            y = max(y - 1, 0)
        elif action == 3:  # Move right
            y = min(y + 1, 9)
        
        self.agent_position = (x, y)
        
        # Check if the agent has reached the target
        reward = 1 if self.agent_position == self.target_position else 0
        return self.agent_position, reward
 
 
# Simple Q-learning agent that uses both visual and textual inputs
class MultiModalRLAgent:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env
        self.q_table = np.zeros((10, 10, 4))  # Q-table for 10x10 grid and 4 actions (up, down, left, right)
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.discount_factor = 0.9
        self.exploration_rate = 1.0
        self.exploration_decay = 0.995
        self.min_exploration_rate = 0.1
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        # Choose action based on epsilon-greedy strategy
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < self.exploration_rate:
            return random.randint(0, 3)  # Random action (exploration)
        else:
            x, y = state
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[x, y])  # Action with the highest Q-value (exploitation)
    
    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        x, y = state
        next_x, next_y = next_state
        # Update Q-table using the Q-learning formula
        best_next_action = np.argmax(self.q_table[next_x, next_y])
        self.q_table[x, y, action] = (1 - self.learning_rate) * self.q_table[x, y, action] + \
                                     self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount_factor * self.q_table[next_x, next_y, best_next_action])
    
    def train(self, num_episodes=1000):
        for episode in range(num_episodes):
            state = self.env.reset()
            total_reward = 0
            
            # Simulate episode steps
            while True:
                action = self.choose_action(state)
                next_state, reward = self.env.step(action)
                total_reward += reward
                self.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
                
                # Check if the agent has reached the target
                if reward == 1:
                    break
                state = next_state
            
            # Decay exploration rate
            self.exploration_rate = max(self.exploration_rate * self.exploration_decay, self.min_exploration_rate)
            if episode % 100 == 0:
                print(f"Episode {episode}, Total Reward: {total_reward}, Exploration Rate: {self.exploration_rate:.2f}")
 
 
# Simulated multi-modal inputs: Using textual feedback to guide the agent
def provide_textual_feedback(state, target_position):
    if state == target_position:
        return "You have reached the target! Well done!"
    else:
        return "Keep going, you're not there yet."
 
# Simulate the environment and agent training
env = Environment()
agent = MultiModalRLAgent(env)
 
# Train the agent using Q-learning with multi-modal feedback
agent.train(num_episodes=1000)
 
# Example of how textual feedback can be used to guide the agent
state = env.reset()
textual_feedback = provide_textual_feedback(state, env.target_position)
print(f"Textual Feedback for Initial State: {textual_feedback}")
What This Does:
Simulated Environment: The agent navigates in a 10x10 grid environment to reach a target position.

Q-learning: The agent uses Q-learning to learn the best actions (up, down, left, right) based on its experiences in the environment, and it adjusts its Q-table accordingly.

Multi-modal Feedback: The agent uses both visual inputs (its position in the grid) and textual feedback (e.g., "Keep going, you're not there yet!") to guide its learning.

Project 960. Multi-modal Generative Models

Multi-modal generative models generate data across multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, or video, based on a unified understanding of different input types. For example, a multi-modal generative model could generate an image from a textual description (text-to-image generation), or produce a detailed textual description of an image (image-to-text generation).

In this project, we simulate a multi-modal generative model that can take a text input (e.g., a description) and generate a corresponding image. Weâ€™ll use the CLIP model to process the text and images and generate multi-modal embeddings. To keep the project simple, weâ€™ll use an image generation library like Stable Diffusion or a pre-trained generative model for text-to-image generation.

Step 1: Text-to-Image Generation
We use a pre-trained generative model like Stable Diffusion to generate an image from the provided text description.

Step 2: Image-to-Text Generation
We can also simulate generating a text description from an image using CLIP.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation for text-to-image generation and image-to-text generation:

Text-to-Image Generation Using a Pre-trained Model (Simulation)
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
clip_model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
clip_processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Step 1: Text-to-Image Generation Simulation (Using pre-trained models or diffusion models)
def generate_image_from_text(text_description):
    # For simplicity, let's assume we have access to a pre-trained text-to-image model.
    # In a real implementation, you would use a model like Stable Diffusion here.
    print(f"Generating image for the description: {text_description}")
    
    # Simulate the image generation (this would use a diffusion model in practice)
    # Here, we use a random image as a placeholder.
    image = Image.open(requests.get("https://via.placeholder.com/150", stream=True).raw)
    
    # Display the generated image
    image.show()
    return image
 
# Example text input (text-to-image generation)
text_input = "A peaceful landscape with mountains and a river"
generated_image = generate_image_from_text(text_input)
 
# Step 2: Image-to-Text Generation using CLIP (simplified)
def generate_text_from_image(image):
    # Process the image and extract features using CLIP
    inputs = clip_processor(text=["a description of the image"], images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    outputs = clip_model(**inputs)
    image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
    text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds
    
    # Calculate cosine similarity between image and text embeddings
    similarity_score = torch.cosine_similarity(image_embeddings, text_embeddings)
    
    # If the similarity score is high, generate a simple description (simplified here)
    if similarity_score.item() > 0.5:
        return "A beautiful landscape with mountains and a river."
    else:
        return "This image doesn't match the given description well."
 
# Example image-to-text generation
generated_description = generate_text_from_image(generated_image)
print(f"Generated Text Description: {generated_description}")
What This Does:
Text-to-Image Generation: Using a pre-trained generative model (in this case, we simulate it with a placeholder image), it generates an image based on a text description.

Image-to-Text Generation: Uses CLIP to compare the generated image and text to simulate generating a text description from an image.
