Project 521: Question Answering with Transformers
Description:
Question answering (QA) is a task in NLP where a system answers questions based on a given text. In this project, we will implement a question answering system using transformer models (e.g., BERT or DistilBERT) to extract answers from context paragraphs.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Question Answering with Hugging Face Transformers)
from transformers import pipeline
 
# 1. Load the pre-trained question answering model
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")
 
# 2. Provide the context and the question
context = """
Transformers are a deep learning model architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" in 2017. 
They have been widely used in NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. 
Transformers rely on attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, as opposed to sequential models like RNNs and LSTMs.
"""

result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
 
# 4. Display the result
print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
Project 522: Abstractive Text Summarization
Description:
Abstractive text summarization involves generating a summary of a text by understanding its meaning and then rephrasing it in a concise form. Unlike extractive summarization, which selects portions of the text, abstractive summarization generates new sentences. In this project, we will use a pre-trained transformer model like BART or T5 to perform abstractive summarization.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Abstractive Text Summarization with Hugging Face Transformers)
from transformers import pipeline
 
# 1. Load the pre-trained summarization model (e.g., BART or T5)
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
 
# 2. Provide the text to be summarized
text = """
Abstractive text summarization is an NLP task where the goal is to generate a summary that is a paraphrased version of the original text. 
This is different from extractive summarization, where the summary is made up of direct excerpts from the original text. 
Abstractive summarization models, like BART and T5, rely on transformer architectures to understand the context and generate coherent summaries. 
These models are trained on large datasets and can summarize long pieces of text into concise, coherent summaries that capture the key ideas.
"""
 
# 3. Use the pipeline to generate the summary
summary = summarizer(text, max_length=50, min_length=25, do_sample=False)
 
# 4. Display the result
print(f"Summary: {summary[0]['summary_text']}")
Project 523: Neural Machine Translation
Description:
Neural machine translation (NMT) involves using deep learning models to translate text from one language to another. In this project, we will use a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., MarianMT from Hugging Face) to perform neural machine translation for translating text from one language to another.

tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
 
# 2. Provide the text to be translated
text = "Hello, how are you today?"
 
# 3. Tokenize the input text
tokens = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# 4. Translate the text

Project 524: Few-Shot Learning for Text Classification
Description:
Few-shot learning enables a model to learn and generalize from a small number of training examples. In this project, we will apply few-shot learning for text classification using transformers like GPT-3 or T5, allowing the model to classify text into categories based on only a few labeled examples.

# 3. Define candidate labels for classification
candidate_labels = ["technology", "healthcare", "finance", "politics"]
 
# 4. Perform the classification with few-shot learning (zero-shot)
result = classifier(text, candidate_labels)
 
# 5. Display the result
print(f"Predicted Category: {result['labels'][0]} with score {result['scores'][0]:.2f}")
Project 525: Zero-Shot Text Classification
Description:
Zero-shot text classification allows the model to classify text into categories without requiring any training data for those categories. Instead, the model uses pre-trained knowledge and is able to classify text into user-defined labels even if it has never seen examples of those categories. We will use a zero-shot classification pipeline from Hugging Face's transformers for this task.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Zero-Shot Text Classification with Hugging Face)
from transformers import pipeline
 
# 1. Load the zero-shot classification pipeline
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
 
# 2. Provide the text to be classified

# 3. Define candidate labels for classification
candidate_labels = ["economy", "finance", "politics", "sports", "technology"]
